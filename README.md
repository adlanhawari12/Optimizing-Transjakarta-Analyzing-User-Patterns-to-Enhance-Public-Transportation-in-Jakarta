**Introduction**
Transjakarta, often referred to as the busway, is a government-supported transportation program aimed at reducing traffic congestion in Jakarta. It is also promoted as a public transport option with guaranteed comfort facilities. According to its official website, Transjakarta is the first Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Southeast and South Asia, operating since 2004 in Jakarta. The Jakarta Regional Government operates Transjakarta to address traffic congestion issues, with the expectation that private vehicle users will switch to using Transjakarta.

**Problem Statement**
Based on the background above, one of Transjakarta's objectives is to reduce traffic congestion by encouraging the use of public transportation. However, there are still many issues faced by Transjakarta. Therefore, PT Transjakarta wants to understand if there are specific patterns in Transjakarta user data to gain insights into the following characteristics:

1. Gender-Based Patterns
2. Age-Based Patterns
3. Payment Patterns
    Based on PayCard Usage
    Based on Revenue from PayCard
4. Daily User Patterns
5. User Patterns Based on Corridors
    Busiest corridors during peak hours
    Busiest stations during peak hours
    Stations frequently used by elderly users

**Key Questions**
How can we optimize the performance of Transjakarta's fleet, facilities, and operational aspects?
